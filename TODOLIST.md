# Ideas

## Medium Priority
// IDEA: We can connect several TODOs together so that we don't have too many features
// IDEA: We can make the landing page more visually appealing and user friendly
// IDEA: We can add a feature that allows users to create and manage projects, including adding new projects and editing existing ones.
// IDEA: We can add a feature that allows users to view and edit the project's settings, such as the project name, description, and API key, this way we can delete the input of adding an API key to create.js.
// IDEA: Should we continue using javascript or switch to typescript?

# Improvements

## High Priority
// TODO: Make the styling of the page better, even my grandma can make something better than this
// TODO: We need to make sure that the user is who they say they are when they are trying to access their projects, we can do this by adding an email verification step to the login process.
// TODO: Add in Create.js we need to make it so the generate button disabled once 1 is clicked and enabled once the generation is done, this way we can prevent the user from clicking it multiple times and generating multiple chapters at once, this can cause the page to crash and the user to lose all the data they entered.
// TODO: Ensuring server.py can handle multiple users at once, this way we can have multiple users using the app at the same time without any issues.
// TODO: Making sure no other user can see anothers API KEY, this way we can prevent any unauthorized access to the API and any data breaches. This can be done by making sure the API KEY is stored in the database and is only accessible to the user who created it. This way we can also make sure that the API KEY is not visible to the user in the URL or in the console.
// TODO: Having a better database

## Medium Priority
// TODO: making sure this wepapp can be viewed gracefully on mobile phones
// TODO: We should make it so that the user can see the progress of the chapter generation, this way they can see if the chapter is being generated or not and if it's taking longer than usual they can cancel it and try again. This can be done by adding a loading spinner or a progress bar to the page. This way the user can also see how long it's taking to generate the chapter and if it's taking longer than usual they can try again with different parameters or try again later. This can also prevent the user from clicking the generate button multiple times and generating multiple chapters at once, this can cause the page to crash and the user to lose all the data they entered.
